â€¢ Overview:
This is a modern Travel Agency website that has the purpose of offering the different travel services/destination packages they offer, connect with their agents and have access to the customizable travel expeiences online in a responsive website that is responsive for any type of devices, it also offers camping products and traveling blogs. Please notice that not all buttons have functionalities, this is due to showcase purposes where every section has extra pages when you click on "Read More", this is a list with the functioning buttons:

-   Header: when you click in any title, this will take you to that specific section. if you click in the logo, will take you to home. I'm still working in the e-commerce page (cart) and the search on box (magnifying glass).

- 	Adventure ideas: the "read more" buttons under "Canoing" and "Glaciers explorations" will redirect you to a page where explains more about those activities.

- 	Featured Products: You can see the different options by clicking on the arrow, each product picture if you hover on it will show icons for "watch", "buy" and "share".

- 	Popular Packages : 3 of the popular packages will redirect you to pages with more details about it and these are: "Morocco For 10 Days", "England In 5 Days" and "Celebrity Silhouette Bahamas" in each page under the "More of..." section you can swipe with the pointer. 

*Note: I would recommend you to refresh the page every time you go to a redirected page

- 	Our Daily Posts: In the blogs section the one under "I Left My Heart In The Mountains" will redirect you to an external page.

- 	Footer: The quick links will take you to different sections of the website

â€¢ What I learned:
I wanted to showcase different CSS animations when accessing to different sections as animations catches attention, I had the opportunity to play more with CSS and made slide functions work on Javascript. 

â€¢ Continued development:
I will be connecting this project to a PHP and MySQL so the forms for the booking/reservation of the different packages sections get completed with an email confirmation. I will also would like to develop more on the cart area when selecting products and the search box engine.
