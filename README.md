- What I learned:

I wanted to showcase different CSS animations when accessing to different sections as animations catches attention, I had the opportunity to play more with CSS and made slide functions work on Javascript. 

- Continued development:
I will be connecting this project to a PHP and MySQL so the forms for the booking/reservation of the different packages sections get completed with an email confirmation.
